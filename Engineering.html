  <strong>Engineer's Conductorless Orchestra Website</strong> <br>

<div class="Paragraph">
  The goal of this 2019 project was assemble the resources from the past 17 years of the Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO) in one place such that it can be easily accessed and used by other groups to begin or enhance their own conductorless orchestra. The resources on the site include scores rearranged for OCOs performers in PDF and Sibelius formats as well as audio from performances when possible.
  <br><br>
  My contribution to this project was two-fold. The first part was the drafting of a website to display the resources. The draft is available to view <a href="https://eco-summer2019.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. This involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create content, layout and functionality for the site.

<div class="Paragraph">
  During the Academic semester of Fall 2018, I took a class at Olin called Principles of Engineering (PoE). The final project for this class was open-ended, and my group decided to create a robot that responds to light and sound stimuli. We began modeling the behavior around the emotion of shyness and the physical design of the bot on the <i>mimosa pudica</i> also called the shameplant.
  <br><br>
  The final product manifested as a potted plant on wheels that used a small array of light and sound sensors to detect and move away from sharp, loud noises and measure and move towards bright light. In order to better display a scared response, the faux leaves on the plant drop and crumple as it moves away from any 'frightening noise' it detects.
  <br><br>
  My particular contributions to the group include ...
